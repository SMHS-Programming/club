# Welcome to Programming Club!!

Hi there! This is the San Mateo High School Programming Club repository where
we will publish all of our works from the club! This repository is inspired from
hackEDU's camp as we are part of their association.

[hackEDU Camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/248ee44840753ed1892cf6e918cb21cb6db77906/cohort_4/playbook)

The goal of Programming Club is to teach new members about coding and have
them ship their products every 4 school weeks.

Programming Club will work on 4 week schedules, 2 meetings per week, week-1 will
go into workshops and learning, week-2-3 will be dedicated to project time to
let Hackers use their new knowledge from week-1 to build a project with other
Hackers. Week-4 will consist of having the Hackers ship their project and
demoing them to the whole club.
