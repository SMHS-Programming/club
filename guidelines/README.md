# Keeping the repository in order

To make sure no files are lost and avoid confusion, follow the following rules:

1. When editing, making or deleting files, you must create a separate
branch or commit to a branch, never commit to master branch.
2. If you do create a new branch, name it with whatever you have edited the
most. Ex: ``` guidelines ```
3. When committing to a branch, name it first with whatever you have edited the
most followed by a brief summary. Ex: ``` guidelines: Added some guidelines ```
4. Once done, do a pull request, which will be named with the commit name,
and assign another other leader to approve the request. In need of an emergency
change, make sure you have everything correct by going to the "Files Changed"
tab in the pull request and accept the request yourself.
